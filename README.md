# Movies

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/movies`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'movies'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install movies

## Usage

This is a simple CLI app which provides instructions while using it. The main menu will populate movies which are opening this week, and the top 20 in theaters. By typing the movie's index number, you can see details about the movie, including genre, rating, length, synopsis, and movie trailer link. 

Also, you can type 'local' and provide your zip code, and your preference for today or tomorrow's movie times, and you can see movie times at all your local theaters.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/micahshute/movies.
